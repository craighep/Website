                  <p>My most recent piece of work involved an existing application, the CSA (Computer
                    sceince alumini) system. This was primarily written using the Ruby language,
                    using the Rails framework. I had a few options in this assignment in terms of
                    providing an assignment solution, but chose a new technology to try out; Cucumber
                    and R-Spec tests. This meant writing out a good deal of functionality testing tests
                    (these were written in the Gherkin and Ruby language) to a total of 95. Alongside
                    this, you can find my report in the Github link below (including the code), and
                    also links to my Travis build server in the Github readme. I had a great deal of fun
                    learning both a new framework to me, and also new means of testing software
                    applications. As this was handed in recently, please check back later for the
                    score I achieved on this assignment!</p>

                  <p>The first assignment In my fourth year of University involved researching,
                  analysing and suggesting ways to use a face detection algorithm outlined
                  in a scientific computer-vision paper. For my assignment, I was required to evaluate
                  a paper looking at face-recognition, and to look at how using the techniques
                  described in the paper would be useful in practical approaches such as people
                  counting in a different range of events. Alongside the paper which you can find
                  in the Github link below, you will also see a set of my own tests I attempted
                  using the OpenCV library, in a set of Python files. I found this a very interesting
                  assignment and module as a whole, and had a lot of fun trying out what is on
                  offer in terms of today's technologies.</p>

                  <p>Following on from my year in industry (the blog can be found <a href="../blog">here</a>),
                  I was required to write a report detailing my experiences and what I had learned during
                  the process of working for a company in the industry I will be aiming to work in
                  after my degree. You will be able to see my final produced report, alongside the source
                  for the document. This report was written in LaTeX, as I feel it looks more
                  professional. There are various diagrams to display the strategies used in my day to day work,
                  alongside the company layout. By looking at the document, I hope it will help you
                  understand better what I did while away on my year in industry, and what I brought
                  back with me to university in terms of skills and experience.</p>

                  <p>This piece of work I completed whilst at University concerns a paper
                    (Research Paper) I wrote into a selection of different scheduling algorithms
                    provided for a small Java simulator program for a range of processes which would test how different algorithms change the order and speed of completion of tasks similar to a CPU. In my paper
                    I looked at algorithms such as First In First Out, the Lottery scheduler,
                    the Prioirty Queue scheduler and the Shortest Job First Algoritm. I found
                    out a lot about each of these algorithms and learnt how each performed
                    under a different variety of tests. I achieved a 1st for this piece of work (
                    73%) and was very happy with the results. The submission of this included
                    my classes containing my algorithms, testing classes, a class diagram and
                    a report detailing my findings...

                  <p>This assignment covered my entire Interactive Web Programming module,
                    and including a report that detailed my design and implementation reasons.
                    I achieved a 1st (80%) In the assignment which I was extremely pleased with,
                    although I did spend an amazing amount of time on this project because of my
                    keen interest in it. The design of my game comprised of an escape the maze style,
                    involving a block which had to be navigated around a map using the keyboard
                    controls. It also included a set of alternative controls using mouse buttons,
                    and the game itself had a range of menus to make gameplay and ease of use
                    much better. I designed the level selection based from the angry birds level
                    menu screens where it would inform you if a level had been done perfectly,
                    done, or not done. Achievemnts and music was present in my game, along with
                    saved progress for users repeat visits. I had an amazing time creating this
                    project and are immensly proud of it!

                    had gained from lectures in the C and C++ llangauges along with the
                    use of previoous assignment I had completed In Java. I was asked to
                    extend the Java version by creating specific modules in the different
                    languages availible. The C++ language section to create files for an event,
                    C to monitor and update checkpoint files, and Java to monitor results
                    and the overall event information. This assignment was coupled alongside
                    a report, which asked me to simply discuss my choices and assumptions of
                    each of the languages. You will find all the source code, and report in the
                    GitHub link below.

                  <p>This project concerned more towards the usability of Web sites
                    and software. I was given a brief, which asked of me to evaluate
                    a set of user requirements, design and implement a site
                    which would not have functionality, but instead simply show the
                    interaction and ways the site would be used. Although my assignments
                    specification said that the site did not have to be full on
                    beautifully implemented and allowed me to use dreamweaver to quickly
                    make the site, I instead chose to go for the full monty and create
                    the site through CSS and HTML. I think I achieved a great looking site
                    which you can view using the link. The report is also on GitHub.

                  <p>This assignment was the first of the second semester
                    handed to me and asked of me to take a data form, find out the
                    different data types and sets, organise and normalise these,
                    resulting eventually in a full SQL implementation of the data
                    using Postgres. For the design, normalisation and implementation
                    stages in this project I achieved an A grade. I was very happy
                    with the ease of learning SQL, and is definitely going to be
                    a useful tool in the future of my career. Once I had managed to
                    install Postgres, it was all plain sailing in terms of creating
                    tables, searching tables or adding any extra functional requirements
                    such as checks on data.

                  <p>Whenever I find I have some free time in the semester, I usually
                    start a project outside of University. This one was a project that helped
                    a friend from home get onto the web. My friend, a music student wanted a
                    simple portfolio site like mine setting up, and I offered to create it
                    for free and made it quite quickly. The site uses a simple scroller for a
                    static page, and contains any details he wanted on the web such as some
                    example sound file work. Again, complete CSS3 and HTML5 was used to achieve
                    this site. Click the link to visit his new site :)

                  <p>This was a major project I took part in alongside a team of 7 other students,
                    and the main aim was to create a Java based web program that would allow users
                    to control virtual 'monsters' with which they could trade, breed and fight with
                    other users. Not only was there interaction, but virtual currency, registration,
                    and even the ability to interact with other groups' programs using a common API.
                    As part of my team I acted as deputy leader to the group, and also head of testing.
                    This was a great project to learn how to work as a team, and gave me a great deal
                    of experience, confidence in teams, and gave me a chance to tinker with JavaEE.

                  <p>This was my first go at one of the C language family. I was set a task to create
                    a way of monitoring a set of track races, considering participants, tracks and courses.
                    The main purpose of this task was to learn the basic in's and out's of C, using the
                    fundamental rules of the language. For instance, the basic storage and entry of races
                    required dynamically increasing/ decreasing the arrays storing data. Because I found C
                    not to have specific dynamic storage types, it helped me understand key functions such
                    as realloc(), allowing reallocation of memory within programs.

                  <p>This was an assignment intended to test my new knowledge of creating efficient
                    algorithms with the purpose of sifting through and using stored data. I created a
                    program that had the ability to link and create word ladders. For instance, my program
                    had the ability to calculate shortest routes between words, where each move meant only
                    changing one letter at a time until the word turned into another. There was also
                    functionality that meant the user could input a word and then specify a word ladder
                    length, then the program would attempt to make a ladder of words. This assignment
                    heavily tested my knowledge of more advanced storage techniques, such as hash-maps/
                    hash-tables etc. This is a great fun little program, definitely worth a look! I should
                    also mention that I used the Linux system dictionary file as the basis for all the
                    word definitions used in the program, so the ladders are impressive!

                  <p>During my second year of study, I was introduced to the assembly language, and
                    was given an assignment to create a small routine that would perform a right-rotate
                    on a set of bits. The idea was that the end bit on a line of bits would drop off the
                    end, and then be placed at the beginning of the line on the left hand side. Although
                    I did manage to create a method to do this, the feedback given back to me was that I
                    had not done it in a way as specified in the brief, so was marked down. Even
                    considering this, I found that I enjoyed learning the basics of assembly (AND, NOR, OR,
                    NOR, NAND gates etc.) and how integrate and fine low level languages can be, even
                    using simple on/off methods.

                  <p>This was another great web project I was glad to have the chance to
                    work on. The main task here was to create a simple online shop using
                    primarily PHP and SQL. The site was made to gather a list of products
                    hosted on the University network, which I then gained a list of using some
                    short SQL SELECT statements, and then display on the site. The users
                    would then be able to add to basket, which would be saved for the session
                    the site was being used. Once users had selected their desired items, the
                    site then allowed the process of checking out, which again was PHP based.
                    I learnt great amounts about the use of Sessions and Cookies in this
                    project and also the use of CSS to make a simple but eye appealing web-
                    shop.

                  <p>A project in an individual format, in which I was asked to create a
                    billing system for a company named &lsquo;aberPizza&rsquo;. In this program
                    (Java) I would need to allow users to enter a name, select a different
                    set of items, (drinks, sides, pizzas), and then add any amount of quantities
                    of each in the order. They would then be able to calculate the total
                    price, input money tendered and then get a change amount, along with
                    an exported receipt in the form of a txt file. In my program I also
                    included a save/ load function for saving a till in its current state,
                    and then load it later. A set of offers was also available to the
                    users where when a certain item and another item was present in the
                    order, some costs were deducted. I found this program rather tricky,
                    especially when calculating the offer deductions. Away from that snag,
                    I did achieve a 1st in this piece of work. Below my program (in GitHub) is in two
                    formats, one as the double clicking executional Jar file, and the other
                    is a Zip of the whole project with documentation.

                  <p>Earlier this calender year I along with two others from my tutor
                    group was asked to work in a team to create a rather sophisticated Java
                    program allowing users to design a UML diagram within it and then
                    export this, save and load it. It meant users would first create a
                    class box, insert information, and then link this to other class boxes.
                    Each box could be freely moved around with the mouse edited and
                    removed! After achieving a 1st for this project, we were very happy
                    with the finished product. Check it out below, the ZIP file contains
                    the Java files, Jar release and documentation.

                  <p>Well, as you can see here, I have already implemented, and quite
                    successfully actually, my new found HTML skills in which I produced a
                    website with for this and for an earlier project in my web module for
                    my second semester.In this site, I
                    had to prove my HTML and Javascript skills. Along with this website, I
                    also had to create a wordpress website from scratch including setting
                    up the wordpress files and adding plug-in etc. I found all this basic
                    stuff, and enjoyed the HTML programming especially. The wordpress link
                    is below, which I found has been a very popular site with friends. I
                    used this as a mini night project where I updated the goings on of my
                    flat daily. Got over 10000 hits to date!

                  <p>So starting at Aberystwyth university, the very first assignment I
                    began was not a graphical one, but a simple command line one. This game
                    &lsquo;Cross the square&rsquo; was intended to allow users to move a
                    player around a 12 by 12 board on the screen avoiding the path of the
                    &lsquo;hunters&rsquo; . The target was for the play to allow as many as
                    possible hunters to get to their destination without touching them.
                    Each Hunter gave a point when it got home and when it hit the player
                    the player lost one of five lives. There were two levels to this game,
                    one achieved when the user hit a score of 42, and after this the
                    hunters became smarter and knew where the player was. This meant they
                    headed towards the player. Because it was a command line game,
                    directions were given by entering a certain key and then pressing
                    enter. At this point, I was really wanting to get on with GUI but as
                    the project said, it was a command line game. I achieved a 1st at this
                    piece of work, and can be found in the link below within a zip file.
                    Similar to an earlier piece of work, 'javac' it first, then java run
                    the &ldquo;Game&rdquo; file in the source folder.

                  <p>Seen the previous project for University? Well I attempted to re-create
                    it in the C++ language. I thought that I could see what the fuss about this
                    language was at the time, and to be honest, I was impressed. It was
                    great experience in seeing the differences between the two languages,
                    especially the input and output methods. Anyway, because of a loss of data
                    due to this project being stored on a rubbish old PC, I cannot provide a copy
                    of the project here. Sorry.

                  <p>Upon pure boredom between assignments at the beginning of University,
                    I decided to take up Java programming up early. In this example, I created
                    a simple log in style screen to test my use of the GUI side of Java.
                    In addition to this, I also thought that it could be cool to test the
                    security features of Java. Although I was fairly new to programming, I
                    looked at the encoding and decoding methods which allowed the storage of
                    logging in data to be stored safely. Anyway, it is not a greatly detailed
                    small project as it only occupied me for a few days before more boredom kicked in.

                  <p>In the second year of college, I had also been shown the visual basic
                    language. I loved this, especially the IDE we used. I mean, the code
                    auto completed commands for me! Anyway, I was set a minor task in this
                    language, to create a type of zoo program. It had its own GUI
                    (Graphical User Interfaces), similar to my First Java program which I
                    learnt how to perform from beginning in Java. Except in java the task
                    was to create a holiday program, one which would calculate plane prices
                    etc. I have discovered this has made my university life much easier
                    since we have had to use GUI&rsquo;s quite a bit. I have to say, Java
                    has always been my favourite language, and showed me what real
                    programming was after VB. Anyway, try out my early VB and Java programs
                    (the VB one will launch when opening, while the Sunny Holiday one will
                    need opening through command line- typing &ldquo;Javac
                    Sunny_Holidays.java&rdquo;, then java Sunny_Holidays&rdquo;.
                    Sorted.)

                    <p>Turbo Pascal- A very simple language which was very easy to master as a
                      beginner. That&rsquo;s what I found out after beginning my software
                      development module and learning how to program in this language. Well I
                      know I was going to link every piece of work here? I doubt you&rsquo;ll
                      have the Pascal platform installed on your PC. If you do, well
                      it&rsquo;s tough now. Basically, I created a weight- postage price
                      checking program, first allowing the user to input the destination
                      country, weight and type of postage. My program would produce a price,
                      easy stuff.

                      <p>Well, here or here about it all started. Back in year 9 in school,
                        myself and a couple of friends decided to look at a small program
                        called Scratch. A programming IDE like this one allowed us to create a
                        couple of games, both shown below in the links. We actually entered
                        these in a competition for the local area of schools, and won. From the
                        competition, we gained a whole day of learning how to write and program
                        our own games with an experienced Software engineer who had helped in
                        projects such as the GTA series and the famous Worms games. This series
                        of projects was where I had really begun to get more serious with my
                        programming!
